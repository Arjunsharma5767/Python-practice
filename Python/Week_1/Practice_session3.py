# Day 03: Python Strings and String Methods
# Strings in python can be defined using single quotes, 
# double quotes, or triple quotes for multi-line strings. 
# Here are some examples of string definitions:
# single_quote_str = 'Hello, World!'
# double_quote_str = "Hello, Python!" 
# triple_quote_str = '''This is a multi-line
# string in Python.'''
